# Managing System Using Banker's Algorithm

This repository implements the Banker's algorithm for system management using Python, along with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The Banker's algorithm is a deadlock-avoidance algorithm commonly used in operating systems to manage resource allocation among multiple processes.

## Overview

The graphical interface provides an interactive platform to simulate the behavior of the Banker's algorithm. Users can initiate requests and releases of resources for different processes, and the system's state is dynamically updated. This implementation facilitates a visual understanding of how the algorithm manages resources to avoid deadlocks.

## Features

- **Simulation of Requests and Releases:** Users can simulate requests and releases of resources for individual processes, observing the impact on the system's state.

- **System Configuration:** The graphical interface allows users to dynamically change the maximum, allocated, and available resources for the system, enabling exploration of different scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (standard Python library)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bankers-algorithm-system-management.git
```
